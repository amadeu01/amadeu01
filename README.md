### 🚀 About Me

[cite_start]I'm an experienced **Mobile Developer** currently focused on **iOS/Swift engineering** at Busbud[cite: 14]. [cite_start]I specialize in architecting **robust and scalable applications** and have a strong history of working across the **full stack**—from building native mobile apps (iOS & Android) to contributing to backend services (Ktor, Rust, Elixir)[cite: 57, 42].

[cite_start]I am passionate about the intersection of clean code, elegant user experience, and **data-driven decision making** to align development work with broader business objectives[cite: 46].

### 🎯 Key Accomplishments & Expertise

These highlights demonstrate the high-impact work I've delivered in previous roles:

* [cite_start]**Payment Architecture & Integration:** Successfully **architected and implemented secure payment flows** by integrating new payment providers and deeply utilizing third-party APIs for Busbud[cite: 27, 28, 29].
* [cite_start]**Mobile Gateway & Backend:** Contributed to the app gateway (built with **Ktor using Kotlin**) at Epidemic Sound, building new endpoints and integrating mobile apps with other internal services[cite: 42, 43].
* [cite_start]**System Rewrites & Architecture:** Individually **engineered and implemented the entire iOS app architecture** for a new native application, successfully replacing a legacy React Native app and ensuring feature parity[cite: 81, 84].
* [cite_start]**Cross-Functional Platform Improvement:** Enhanced the developer experience at Pipefy by implementing core changes to both the backend (**Rust**, **Elixir**, and Ruby) and client-side applications (**Swift** and **Kotlin**)[cite: 57, 54].
* [cite_start]**Mentorship & Feature Ownership:** As a Senior Developer, I served as a **feature architect**, overseeing the full lifecycle from design to deployment, and **mentored junior developers** through pair and mob programming[cite: 40, 41, 44].
* [cite_start]**Quality & Monitoring:** Proactively improved app stability by filtering out irrelevant errors in monitoring tools like **Sentry** to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing teams to focus on critical issues[cite: 33, 35].
