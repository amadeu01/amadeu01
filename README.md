# 👋 Hi, I'm Amadeu Cavalcante

**Mobile Developer | iOS/Swift Engineer | Backend Contributor**

### 🚀 About Me

I'm an experienced **Mobile Developer** currently focused on **iOS/Swift engineering** at Busbud. I specialize in architecting robust and scalable applications and have a strong history of working across the full stack—from building native mobile apps (iOS & Android) to contributing to backend services (Ktor, Rust, Elixir).

I am passionate about the intersection of clean code, elegant user experience, and data-driven decision making to align development work with broader business objectives.

### 🎯 Key Accomplishments & Expertise

These highlights demonstrate the high-impact work I've delivered in previous roles:

* **Payment Architecture & Integration:** Successfully architected and implemented secure payment flows by integrating new payment providers and deeply utilizing third-party APIs for Busbud.
* **Mobile Gateway & Backend:** Contributed to the app gateway (built with **Ktor** using Kotlin) at Epidemic Sound, building new endpoints and integrating mobile apps with other internal services.
* **System Rewrites & Architecture:** Individually engineered and implemented the entire iOS app architecture for a new native application, successfully replacing a legacy React Native app and ensuring feature parity.
* **Cross-Functional Platform Improvement:** Enhanced the developer experience at Pipefy by implementing core changes to both the backend (**Rust**, **Elixir**, and Ruby) and client-side applications (**Swift** and **Kotlin**).
* **Mentorship & Feature Ownership:** As a Senior Developer, I served as a feature architect, overseeing the full lifecycle from design to deployment, and mentored junior developers through pair and mob programming.
* **Quality & Monitoring:** Proactively improved app stability by filtering out irrelevant errors in monitoring tools like **Sentry** to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing teams to focus on critical issues.
